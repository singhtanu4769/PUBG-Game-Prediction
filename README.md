# PUBG-Game-Prediction
## Description
This project aims to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting match outcomes in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) using advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing gameplay data, including player movements, engagements, and environmental variables, the model provides actionable insights to enhance decision-making and strategy formulation in competitive gaming.

# Features
* Predictive model for forecasting PUBG match outcomes.
* Data collection and preprocessing from PUBG matches.
* Utilization of machine learning algorithms, including CatBoost and Random Forest.
* Exploratory data analysis to uncover insights into player behavior and match dynamics.
* Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
