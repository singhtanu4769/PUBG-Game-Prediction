# PUBG-Game-Prediction
#Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting match outcomes in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) using advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing gameplay data, including player movements, engagements, and environmental variables, the model provides actionable insights to enhance decision-making and strategy formulation in competitive gaming.

#Key Features
Data Collection: Gathers and preprocesses data from PUBG matches, including player statistics and match dynamics.
Machine Learning Techniques: Utilizes algorithms such as CatBoost, Random Forest, and others to classify match outcomes as wins or losses.
Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant gameplay metrics to improve model accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizes data distributions and relationships to uncover insights into player behavior and match dynamics.
Model Evaluation: Employs cross-validation and various performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) to assess model effectiveness.
